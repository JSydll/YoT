# Yasbi: Yocto-driven Raspberry Pi

## Infrastructure

To have the possibility to easily get the latest changes from the repositories this repo depends on, `git subtree` is used. This enables easy amendments made to the whole tree without committing to the external repos.

## Setup

1. Run `sudo ./installDependencies.sh` to get required packages for a yocto build.
