# meta-fw-update-raspberrypi

Aside from some general configuration for firmware updates, very target specific adjustments 
of the build are necessary to have a running and updateable image. This layer provides these 
for the raspberrypi machine.

This layer depends on meta-fw-update and on meta-swupdate respectively.
