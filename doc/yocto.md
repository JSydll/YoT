# General learnings about Yocto

## Basic principles

One of Yocto's key concepts is the separation of functionality/configuration 
into layers. Upper layers extend or override lower ones (with `.bbappend` files). 
The base functionality is usually provided by the core poky layers.

## Writing recipes

- [Documentation on recipes](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/dev-manual/dev-manual.html#new-recipe-writing-a-new-recipe)
- [Recipe syntax](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/dev-manual/dev-manual.html#recipe-syntax)
- [Detailed bitbake documentation of the recipe/task syntax](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/3.1/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual.html#bitbake-user-manual-metadata)
- [Variables in the recipe context](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/3.1/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#ref-varlocality-recipe-required)
- Don't forget to include a package generated by a recipe (actually a `.bb` file) somewhere in your image, 
  using `IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " <packageName> "`.
- When defining licenses, you need to include a checksum:
  ```
  LICENSE = "MIT"
  LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"
  ```
- 

## Writing tasks

- Tasks can only be implemented as shell or Bitbake-style functions


## Debugging and coping with errors

- Run `bitbake -e <command>` to get the environment dumped and `grep` for variables there
- Check the `${WORKDIR}/temp` directory for log files (exists for all performed recipes/tasks)
- If bitbake runs out of memory, try removing the `build/temp` folder. Preserving the `build/downloads` 
  and `build/sstate` folders, this should not increase build time of the next run too much.
