# Compile-time wifi configuration

Goal of the compile-time configuration is that the target is connected or can be connected to 
out of the box.

There are three possible configurations:
- Client mode (target is connected to a host network)
  - w/ static IP
  - using DCHP
- Access point mode (target provides a wifi network to connect to)
